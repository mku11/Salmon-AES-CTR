# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle

# Build and Test code
# This workflow doesn't support:
# * GPU build and tests
# * SalmonWin tests (windows registry and connection to Salmon WinService)
# * Salmon HttpFS and WSFS tests (need HTTP server and WebFS service in a container)
# * Android tests
# * .NET Android tests
# * Python build and tests
# * JavaScript build and tests

# Note: if you have cache misses then make sure this workflow runs in the main branch first for the same cache keys.
