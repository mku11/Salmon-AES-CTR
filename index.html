			<H3>So why another encryption library?</H3>
			<pre>
- Blazing fast CPU and GPU acceleration.  
- Parallel baked-in encryption and decryption of data arrays, streams, and files.  
- Low ceremony API for read/write/seek operations.  
- Data integrity with interleaved HMAC signatures with a per-chunk authentication scheme.
- Use of sequential nonces with strict ranges so no birthday problem.
- Nonce sequences reside outside of encrypted drives so you can have multiple fully operational clones and backups.  
- Import new files in virtual drives using multiple authorized devices.  
- Sequence ranges are stored in app protected space (Android only).  
- Any tampering is detected using an encrypted SHA256 checksum (Win10/11 only).  
- Additional protection from non-admin users (Salmon Windows Service Win10/11 only).  
- API for several popular programming languages, platforms, and operating systems.  
- Implementation is based on abstract components which can easily be extended.  

Comparison:
- Salmon uses AES-CTR which supports random access unlike GCM.  
- Salmon uses HMAC-SHA256 which supports authentication unlike XTS.  
- Salmon uses AES which supports hardware acceleration unlike Salsa20 and Chacha20.

			<H3>Sequence Files</H3>
			<pre>
User sequencer files keep information about the sequence ranges so they need to be kept in a protected space. Someone who has write access to a sequencer file and repeated read access to your encrypted files can leak encrypted information about your files. Also make sure that you never backup and restore the nonce sequencer files! You should always create them under a directory that is exluded from your backups, this will prevent nonce reuse!  

More specifically:  
- Android: You must create sequencer files in protected app space and not on external storage! Android apps work on sandbox environments so the sequence files are protected from other apps. Though for rooted devices there is no such guarantee since any app can run as a superuser.  
- Windows: You should create a sequencer file under %LOCALAPPDATA% folder. Salmon for Windows will detect if a file is tampered with though it is recommended for additional security that you use the Salmon Windows Service. The Salmon Service is a better solution because it protects the sequencer files under a system administrator (LocalSystem) account.  
- Linux/Mac: You can create a sequencer file under your $HOME folder. Keep in mind that Salmon has no anti-tampering support for these operating systems. Therefore, if you want to prevent other apps having access to the sequencer file you can do is implement a protected service like the equivalent of Salmon Windows Service or create your own tampering detection. You can do the latter by extending SalmonFileSequencer class, see WinFileSequencer implementation as an example.

		<div class="functional-limitations-container">
			<H3>Functional Limitations</H3>
			<pre>
- Salmon streams are seekable only if the backed resource supports random access (disk, memory, network).  
- Salmon API is not Thread Safe! If you want to use parallel processing you need to use SalmonEncryptor/SalmonDecryptor and SalmonFileImporter/SalmonFileExporter.  
- Maximum guaranteed file size: 2^64 bytes or limited by the backed resource (disk, memory, network).  
- Maximum drive file size: 2^64 bytes  
- Maximum number of drive files: 2^62 (64 bit nonces used for the filename and the file contents.  
- Python parallel processing (multiple cpus) in Windows is slow due to python being single-threaded.  
- Javascript implementation uses only the default platform crypto and not the salmon native implementation.
- Javascript service worker handler does not support parallel processing.  
- Javascript implementation is ESM so in order to work in Node.js you need to use --experimental-vm-modules  
- Data integrity works with file contents but not filenames.
