The sample scripts will test the samples with the right dependencies  

For Windows you can run the bat scripts and some of the sh scripts using WSL or Cygwin.  
For Linux and macOS you can run the sh scripts.  

Before you start  
Make sure you sync the project properties (version numbers) by running sync_settings.sh under scripts/misc folder  
Then build the libraries using the scripts in scripts/deploy
